# Pastoral Project
For our final project in my Literary Inquiry: The Pastoral course, I was asked to create a project that was the equivalent of a 12-page term paper that analyzed some portion of the course or connected in some way. I opted to utilize Tensorflow and Text Generation using a Recurrent Neural Network to consume the works of pastoral literature from the course and create poems. 

I then built a web-interface for the project, so people could see what the model was generating. If you'd like to see the web component, you can do so [here](https://pastoralproject.herokuapp.com).
