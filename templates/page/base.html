                        <p>
                            Hello there. To take a look at some of the poetry generated by the recurrent neural net,
                            please use the
                            button below.
                            By default, the model will display 1000 characters of generated poetry, with varying
                            temperature levels.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is some interesting behavior here, seeing as with some of the samples, the model
                            doesn't produce 1000 characters, even though its asked. I wonder if this has something to
                            do with getting caught in a loop where it just generates spaceS? Will be necessary to
                            investigate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you see a temperature value that's closer to 1.0, it means the generated text is more
                            experimental. Temperature values that are closer to 0.0 are more probabilistic, meaning that
                            the model relies more heavily on the calculated model to generate text.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For my final project in Honors Literary Inquiry: The Pastoral, we were tasked with creating
                            some sort of
                            project roughly equivalent to a 14-page term paper. All quarter, we had been discussing
                            different pastoral elements found in literature through various poems, books, and videos.
                            In one of the novels we read,<em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em> by Philip Dick,
                            there was a moment when one of the characters, John Isidore begins to theorize about how a
                            certain talkshow host named Buster Friendly, has the time to produce the content displayed
                            during his 24/7 audio and
                            video show.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The answer, to any human reading the novel, is that Buster Friendly is an android, tasked
                            solely with generating content to put on air during his show. This section got me wondering,
                            is it possible to have a computer generate content with some of the pastoral elements we've
                            discussed in class using today's technology? So I got to researching. I found a tutorial
                            on TensorFlow's website about generating text using a Recurrent Neural Network, and began my
                            proceedings there.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thanks to a dataset I found on Kaggle, I had access to 22.09MB of poetry from the Poetry
                            Foundation's website, which would serve as the training set for my mode. I also spiced it up
                            by adding the works of a few of the authors we talked about in class. After training the
                            model, I could begin asking it to generate poetry of its own, some of which you can view
                            under the "Generate Poetry" tab.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you'd like to learn more about the specific tech used in this project, or see how I
                            interpret some of the poems generated (warning, I'm pretty awful at poetry interpretation
                            ðŸ™‚), feel free to check out the Techincals or Analysis tabs, respectively.

                        <h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Machine Learning Component</h4>
                        <p>
                            The machine learning component for this project was written in Python using primarily
                            Tensorflow
                            and NumPy. Jupyter notebook was leveraged for model training and text generation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ML Algorithm itself was heavily based on the <a
                                href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation" target="_blank">RNN
                            Text
                            Gen</a> tutorial hosted on the TensorFlow website, with a few minor tweaks to fit the
                            specific use case.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Web Component</h4>
                        <p>
                            The web portion of this project was written using Django, and deployed using Heroku. In an
                            ideal world, the RNN would have been hosted in AWS SageMaker and live queried during user
                            interaction, but hosting in SageMaker was more expensive than I anticipated, so I had to get
                            a little bit creative.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What I did was once my model was sufficiently trained, I had it generate 2,500 1,000
                            character text samples with random temperature values and output them. Then, I was able to
                            store those snippets in an S3 bucket and just pull them at random into the Web App.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hacky, I know, but I don't have the budget to be incurring those AWS hosting fees ðŸ˜Š
                        </p>

                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="analysis" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="analysis-tab">

                        <h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Again, don't judge me on this, I'm a CS guy, not a poet.</p>

                        <p>The first poem I've selected is this one:</p>
                        <div class="container">
                            <span id="poetry">And as the world is still a tree, a noise and story in the sink of the earth's soul,</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>This poem is particularly interesting to me and has some clear reference to the pastoral.
                            The poem begins by alluding to the world actually being a tree, then using the language
                            "noise and story". This line made me think that the author (haha) is alluding to a family
                            tree as opposed to a literal tree. I say this because thinking of noise and story
                            immediately
                            conjures up the image of a noisy family gathering, with shared oral stories and a human
                            structured tree of relatives and relations. Perhaps this isn't the inherent meaning though,
                            because calling family trees the "sink of the earth's soul" is a rather narcissistic
                            viewpoint.
                        </p>

                        <div class="container">
                            <span id="poetry">Return to the Salmon Days of manifest and storms, And soon the sea was shattering there all in time, And the years later, when people Art thine between thee for being strong, so he that launchoused her in marker I've trying to go at the mood, only the shadow of the little tongue where they were huddled so as they met a book in the sea</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            I haven't too much to say about this one, but I really like the way it begins. There's a
                            power to it that I think parallels what's experienced by sailors at sea. Maybe I'm reading
                            into it but for some reason this one resonated with me.
                        </p>
                        <div class="container">
                            <span id="poetry">Out of the dead and the ground of the Mongon Strike and fall, to the street loose the soldier heat in the bed and the fact that sang From the mountain shade of the moon that starts by the steel and strange and struggle;</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Again, there's a little section of this that I'd like to focus on. The final line talking
                            about the Mountain Shade was a line that I really enjoyed. I loved the image it created of a
                            moon and a mountain and the shadows that fall in moonlight. Was very much a fan of it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So clearly, the algorithm isn't perfect yet. It's grasping some concepts of rhyming, but it
                            lacks any central theme. Overall though, I'm very proud with the way this project came out
                            and the content it was able to create. Perhaps moving forward I'll need to return to this
                            project in a few years and see if I can't make it write even better poetry :)
